# Python/Django Polling Web Application
This is a simple web application that I created using the Python based web framework Django.  I am still working on this application, but when it is 
complete it will allow users to answer simple multiple choice questions and record that data.  This is my first application using Django and therefore I decided to keep it a little simple to start.

### Tools and Technology Implemented
The underlying development language used for this web application is Python.  The website has been created using the Django framework for Python.  I decided not to bother setting up a MySQL database and went instead 
with the built in SQLite database.
